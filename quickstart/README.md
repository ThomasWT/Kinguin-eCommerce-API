## Apply for access

First go to [Kinguin Integration](https://www.kinguin.net/integration) and apply for the **Kinguin Api E-Commerce** account.

Before apply you must to have registered and accepted Kinguin ID account.


## Create store

We'll inform you when your application is accepted.

Sign in on Dashboard and add store in **My Stores** section.

After you verify the store, store API key will be generated and you can use it to [authorize](../api/README.md#authorization) HTTP requests.

> Keep your API key secret!. Remember that credentials on SANDBOX environment are different.

## Search products

[Search products](../api/products/v1/README.md#search-products) you want to offer to your customers.

```bash
curl -X GET \
     -H 'X-Api-Key: [api-key]' \
     https://gateway.kinguin.net/esa/api/v1/products?name=forza
```

## Place order

[Place order](../api/order/v1/README.md#place-order) with selected products.

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H 'X-Api-Key: [api-key]' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"products":[{"kinguinId":1949,"qty":1,"name":"Counter-Strike: Source Steam CD Key","price":5.79"}]}' \
     https://gateway.kinguin.net/esa/api/v1/order
```

## Dispatch

After creating order you need to [dispatch](../api/order/v2/README.md#dispatch) it.

```bash
curl -X GET \
     -H 'X-Api-Key: [api-key]' \
     https://gateway.kinguin.net/esa/api/v2/order/PHS84FJAG5U/dispatch
```

Due to the asynchronous nature of order processing, the API may return an error marked as `retryable`. 
This means that the order is still being processed. 
As long as the API returns an `retryable` error, the request should be retried at appropriate intervals.
The exception to the rule are PRE-ORDER products, where the request should be retried only after product release date.

## Get keys

After dispatching you can [get keys](../api/order/v2/README.md#get-keys).

```bash
curl -X GET \
     -H 'X-Api-Key: [api-key]' \
     https://gateway.kinguin.net/esa/api/v2/order/PHS84FJAG5U/keys
```
