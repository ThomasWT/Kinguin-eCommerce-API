- `OrderPartiallyDispatched`
- `ProcessingPreorder`

Retryable kinds should have set additional property `retryable`.

It means that the order is being processed and the request should be repeated until the correct response from API will be received.
It may happen that for some reasons the order stuck, so you should define a certain limit of requests and contact our Customer Support to resolve a problem.
