# Store ip whitelist

You can force additional authorization for your keys and orders by enabling whitelist of IP addresses from where requests will be sent to our API.

Addresses can be configured for each store separately.

### How to configure whitelist

Contact your business manager and pass them the list of your store ip addresses.

From now on, ordering, dispatching and key retrieval will be additionally protected.
