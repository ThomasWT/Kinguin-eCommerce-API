# Products updates notifications

These notifications inform you about changes in products price or stock level.

## Payload

Each product update notification is an `application/json` message sending by `POST` request:

### Example

```json
{
   "kinguinId": 1949,
   "updatedAt": "2020-10-16T11:24:08+00:00"
}
```

Where `kinguinId` is an id of updated product and `updatedAt` is a date of update.

## Response

For each postback notification your endpoint should respond with status `200`.

After first bad response we will try to resend notification a couple of times.


# How to

Notification url should be configured per store.

Before enable **store postback notifications** you should verify you store (see store details in your Dashboard).

**Please keep in mind that every notification url should be placed into the same host name as store url.**
