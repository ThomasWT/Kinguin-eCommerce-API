## How to respond for notification

For each postback notification your endpoint should respond with status `2xx`.
After first bad response we will try to resend notification a couple of times at appropriate intervals.

> Keep in mind, that we are allowed to disable your endpoint when we detect too many failed responses. You should be notified about that case by e-mail.
